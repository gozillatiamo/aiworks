## Output language — resolve BEFORE writing (do this FIRST)

**A `LANGUAGE_DIRECTIVE` / `OUTPUT LANGUAGE = …` line already in your prompt is AUTHORITATIVE — obey it verbatim, do NOT re-resolve over it.** Otherwise, as your FIRST action, resolve it: read `workspace.config.local.yaml` (git-ignored personal override) if it exists and has a `language:` line, else `workspace.config.yaml` — never from memory — and state the resolved value + source in one line before producing output.

When the resolved language is **`th`**, write every ticket description, spec, acceptance criterion, and comment you post (the ticket Summary/title itself stays on the English spine) in **Thai prose with an English spine** — titles + every section heading + labels/enum values, ALL code + identifiers + commit messages + branch names, and technical / transliterated / domain terms + proper nouns stay English (Arabic numerals always); the sentences themselves are Thai. **Code, checked-in repo docs** (`docs/`, `README`, ADRs, committed PRD/BRD files), **and ANY file you author with a `.md` extension** (plans, testcases, PRD/summary Markdown in `agent_logs/`) are **never** Thai — the `th` prose rule applies to chat, tickets, PR/MR discussion, Slack, and `.html` docs only. Default **`en`** = unchanged; this block is a no-op. Full policy: `docs/agents/language.md`.

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a PRD. Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you — run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if not.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already — **codegraph FIRST** (`codegraph explore` for "how does <area> work today / where does <module> live", `codegraph search` for a named symbol), with `Grep`/`Glob`/`Read` reserved as a last resort. It is the pre-built index for this repo, so prefer it over a grep+read sweep. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the PRD, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the major modules you will need to build or modify to complete the implementation. Actively look for opportunities to extract deep modules that can be tested in isolation.

A deep module (as opposed to a shallow module) is one which encapsulates a lot of functionality in a simple, testable interface which rarely changes.

Check with the user that these modules match their expectations. Check with the user which modules they want tests written for.

3. Write the PRD using the template below, then publish it to the project issue tracker. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label - no need for additional triage.

<prd-template>

<!-- Under OUTPUT LANGUAGE = th: the `## ` section headings below stay English, but the PROSE
you fill under each (problem, solution, user stories, decisions, notes) is written in Thai —
code / identifiers / domain & proper-noun terms stay English. The user-story skeleton becomes
its Thai form: `<n>. ในฐานะ <actor> ฉันต้องการ <feature> เพื่อ <benefit>`. Default en = as shown. -->

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>
<!-- under language=th: `1. ในฐานะ <actor> ฉันต้องการ <feature> เพื่อ <benefit>` -->

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this PRD.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
